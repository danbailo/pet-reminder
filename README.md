## The project

Scholars who are part of the PET receive a monthly support grant, and this project aims to send an email to the grantee notifying them that the grant has dropped into their account, and with that, it is easier to follow the progress of the benefit, as the person may need the money, or prevent him from losing the benefit, since the grant can only be accumulated twice at most.
